      COVID-19 has been the reason for multiple changes and regulations in Ontario.
      Recently it has been announced that Ontario is set to move into step 2 of its reopeinig plan. One change that this has brought is that indoor dining has been banned. On the other hand outdoor dining with up to 6 people per table is allowed. The purpose of this website is to inform users which restaurants around them have outdoor dining areas. 
      Not all restaurants have outdoor seeting areas therefore you can use this website in order to see which ones do.</p>
