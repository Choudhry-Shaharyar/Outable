Motivation: COVID-19 has been the reason for multiple changes and regulations in Ontario. Recently it has been announced that Ontario is set to move into step 2 of its reopeinig plan. One change that this has brought is that indoor dining has been banned. On the other hand outdoor dining with up to 6 people per table is allowed. The purpose of this website is to inform users which restaurants around them have outdoor dining areas.
